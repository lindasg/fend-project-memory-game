# Memory Game Project

## What is the Memory Game
This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons.

## Challenge
Match cards in less time with less moves.

## Instructions
* Click on a card
* Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remember each unveiled card.
* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time
* Rating: Moves <= 12 -> 3 stars, 12 < Moves < 18 -> 2 stars, Moves >= 18 -> 1 stars


## How I built the Memory Game
* created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
* created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
* create a pop-up modal when player wins game
